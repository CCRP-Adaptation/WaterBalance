\title{Soil Water Content (SWC)}
\usage{
get_soil(w, swc.0 = NULL, pet, w_pet, swc.max)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A time series vector of available water for soil charging (rain + snowmelt).}

\item{swc.0}{(optional) The initial soil water content value. Default is 0.}

\item{pet}{A time series vector of PET.}

\item{w_pet}{A time series vector of the difference between w and pet.}

\item{swc.max}{The maximum soil water-holding capacity of the soil layer being assessed.}
}
\description{
Calculates soil water content from available water (rain + snowmelt), PET, max. water-holding capacity, and initial SWC.
