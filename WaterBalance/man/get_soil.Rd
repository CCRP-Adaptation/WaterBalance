}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A time series vector of available water for soil charging (rain + snowmelt).}

\item{swc.0}{(optional) The initial soil water content value. Default is 0.}

\item{pet}{A time series vector of PET.}

\item{swc.max}{The maximum soil water-holding capacity of the soil layer being assessed.}
